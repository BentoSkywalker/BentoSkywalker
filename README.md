__*The Force Awakens*__

Now that I'm looking for a new career path in the data industry, 
I'm considering a Data Scientist position, which involves data mining and extracting relevant information from both structured and unstructured data.
Also with Data skills it's can be useful in a variety of situations, including for example Business Driven Decisions and Marketing Analysis.
