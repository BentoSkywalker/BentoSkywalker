### __*The Force Awakens*__:stars:	:star:



*"You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting."*

:crescent_moon:  The phrase from Shmi told to Anakin Skywalker in Phantom Menace, Signifying introduces a theme what will be present in every movies in the Prequels.
The setting sun is a recurring symbol of change, marking milestones in the story of Star wars saga. :film_strip:

:earth_asia:	The world is changing faster than ever and creating exponentially more data, but in reality the data that generated is can be used less that 10% of all amount.

This truth indicates that there is a lack of symmetry in the implementation of data generated around the world.

:crossed_swords: Therefore, I've decided to become a __*Jedi*__ in order to assist in restoring balance to the world.
Through training and learning, I hope to one day become a Jedi Knight who can assist in maintaining the world's equilibrium. :balance_scale:

:wheel_of_dharma: If our interesting are coincidential the same, the force will guild us to the path that we can cross to each other, somedays. :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

*May the force be with you,
feel free to review my repository.*

:gem: And lastly the quote from my respected Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn: *“Be mindful of the future. But not at the expense of the moment.”*

*( New Hope :sunrise_over_mountains: : Even in the darkest night, the dream of dawn is still alive, Leia founds a loving home on Alderaan, and Luke is in the arms of Owen and Beru on Tatooine. The Prequels are ending with the twins and the twin suns, an image what promises just like you can not stop the suns from setting, you can not stop them from rising either. ref. : https://starwars.fandom.com/f/p/4400000000000027982)*
